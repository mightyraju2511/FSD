1. In the VS Code Terminal with your virtual environment activated, run the administrative utility's 
startapp command in your myproject folder (where manage.py resides): 
python manage.py startapp fruits_and_students
2. Modify fruits_and_students/views.py to match the following code. 
#views.py 
from django.shortcuts import render 
def fruits_and_students(request): 
print(request.build_absolute_uri()) 
fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Grapes'] 
students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'] 
return render(request, 'fruits_and_students/fruits_and_students.html', {'fruits': fruits, 
'students': students})
3. Create a file, fruits_and_students/urls.py, with the contents below. The urls.py file is where you specify 
patterns to route different URLs to their appropriate views. 
#urls.py (fruits_and_students/urls.py) 
from django.urls import path 
from .views import fruits_and_students 
urlpatterns = [ 
path('', fruits_and_students, name='fruits_and_students'), 
]
4. The myproject folder also contains a urls.py file, which is where URL routing is actually handled. Keep 
in mind the myproject/urls.py will be used to handle all of the laboratory component apps’ that will be 
built. Just add the path url routing line of code to the urlpatterns list every time in the already existing 
code. 
#urls.py (myproject/urls.py) 
from django.contrib import admin 
from django.urls import path, include 
urlpatterns = [ 
path("", include("myapp.urls")), 
path("admin/", admin.site.urls), 
path('fruits_and_students/', include('fruits_and_students.urls')), 
]
5. In the myproject/settings.py file, locate the INSTALLED_APPS list and add the following entry, which 
makes sure the project knows about the app so it can handle templating: 
‘fruits_and_students’.
6. Inside the fruits_and_students folder, create a folder named templates, and then another subfolder named 
fruits_and_students to match the app name (this two-tiered folder structure is typical Django convention). 
In the templates/fruits_and_students folder, create a file named fruits_and_students.html with the 
contents below.
#fruits_and_students.html (fruits_and_students/templates/fruits_and_students/ 
fruits_and_students.html)
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en"> 
<head> 
<meta charset="UTF-8"> 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
<title>Fruits and Students</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
<h1>Fruits</h1> 
<ul>
{% for fruit in fruits %}
<li>{{ fruit }}</li> 
{% endfor %} 
</ul> 
<h1>Selected Students</h1> 
<ol> 
{% for student in students %} 
<li>{{ student }}</li> 
{% endfor %} 
</ol> 
</body> 
</html>
7. Save all modified files. 
8. In the VS Code Terminal, again with the virtual environment activated, run the development 
server with python manage.py runserver and open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
9. In the url box of the browse, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/fruits_and_students to view the 
output.
