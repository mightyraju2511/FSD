1. In the VS Code Terminal with your virtual environment activated, run the administrative utility's 
startapp command in your myproject folder (where manage.py resides): 
 
2. Modify website_pages/views.py to match the following code. 
#views.py 
from django.shortcuts import render 
def home(request): 
return render(request, 'website_pages/home.html') 
def about_us(request): 
return render(request, 'website_pages/about_us.html') 
def contact_us(request): 
return render(request, 'website_pages/contact_us.html')
3. Create a file, website_pages/urls.py, with the contents below. The urls.py file is where you specify 
patterns to route different URLs to their appropriate views. 
#urls.py (website_pages /urls.py) 
from django.urls import path 
from website_pages import views 
urlpatterns = [ 
path('home/', views.home, name='home'), 
path('about_us/', views.about_us, name='about_us'), 
path('contact_us/', views.contact_us, name='contact_us'), 
]
4. The myproject folder also contains a urls.py file, which is where URL routing is actually handled. 
#urls.py (myproject/urls.py)
from django.contrib import admin 
from django.urls import path, include 
urlpatterns = [ 
path("", include("myapp.urls")), 
path("admin/", admin.site.urls), 
path('fruits_and_students/', include('fruits_and_students.urls')), 
path('', include('website_pages.urls')), 
]
5. In the myproject/settings.py file, locate the INSTALLED_APPS list and add the following entry, 
which makes sure the project knows about the app so it can handle templating: 
‘website_pages’.
6. Inside the website_pages folder, create a folder named templates. Inside the templates folder, 
create a file named layout.html. 
#templates/layout.html (The CSS is optional)
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en"> 
<head> 
<meta charset="UTF-8"> 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
<title>{% block title %}My Website{% endblock %}</title> 
<style>
body { 
font-family: Arial, sans-serif; 
margin: 0; 
padding: 0; 
}
header { 
background-color: #333; 
color: #fff; 
padding: 10px; 
}
nav ul { 
list-style-type: none;
padding: 0; 
}
nav ul li { 
display: inline; 
margin-right: 20px; 
} 
nav ul li a { 
text-decoration: none; 
color: #fff; 
}
main { 
padding: 20px; 
}
footer { 
background-color: #333; 
color: #fff; 
text-align: center; 
padding: 10px; 
position: fixed; 
bottom: 0; 
width: 100%;
} 
</style> 
</head>
<body> 
<header> 
<nav> 
<ul> 
<li><a href="{% url 'home' %}">Home</a></li> 
<li><a href="{% url 'about_us' %}">About Us</a></li> 
<li><a href="{% url 'contact_us' %}">Contact Us</a></li> 
</ul> 
</nav> 
</header>
<main> 
{% block content %} 
{% endblock %} 
</main>
<footer> 
<p>&copy; 2024 My Website. All rights reserved. </p> 
<p>Developed by EPCET</p> 
</footer>
</body> 
</html>
7. Inside the templates folder, create another subfolder named website_pages to match the app name (this 
two-tiered folder structure is typical Django convention). 
In the templates/website_pages folder, create files named home.html, about_us.html, and contact_us.html 
with the contents below.
#home.html (website_pages/templates/website_pages/home.html) 
{% extends 'layout.html' %} 
{% block title %}Home{% endblock %} 
{% block content %}

8. Save all modified files. 
9. In the VS Code Terminal, again with the virtual environment activated, run the development server with 
python manage.py runserver and open a browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
10.In the url box of the browse, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/home to view the output. Similarly, you 
can navigate through by clicking on the navigation menu. Also check out http://127.0.0.1:8000/about_us 
and http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact_us
